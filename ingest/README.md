# ingest

Pull data from `provider` API endpoints and load to a Postgres database.

## Running

First, copy and edit the sample configuration file:

```bash
cp .config.sample .config
```

Next, ensure the image is up to date locally:

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache ingest
```

Then run the data ingester:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm ingest [OPTIONS]
```

## Docker Container Configuration

The ingest service pulls data from `provider` API endpoints in the time interval that’s specified in the command line arguments. The ingest will store all of the data in memory until the entire time interval is traversed. So, in the case that a large time interval is specified in the command line arguments, it’s possible that default or existing Docker configuration for container resources may not be enough to persist all the data in memory at once.

It’s recommended to batch your ingests into smaller time windows. **We’ve found batching ingests with 1 month time windows for status_changes and one week windows for trips to be performant.** However, if it’s needed to ingest a large time window at once, you should increase the memory of your containers by [editing the advanced preferences of your Docker application.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44533437).

A good benchmark is **4 GB memory per 3 months of data for ingesting status changes, and 4 GB memory per 1 day of data for ingesting trips.**

## [OPTIONS]

Note: you must provide a range of time to query using some combination of `start_time`, `end_time`, and `duration`.

### Backfilling

Using all three time parameters together defines a *backfill*, between `start_time` and `end_time`, in blocks of size `duration`.

Subsequent backfill blocks overlap the previous block by `duration/2` seconds. Buffers on both ends ensure events
starting or ending near a time boundary are captured.

For example `2018-12-31` with a 6 hour duration:

```bash
--start_time 2018-12-31T00:00:00 --end_time 2018-12-31T23:59:59 --duration 21600
```

Results in the following backfill requests:

- `2018-12-31 20:59:59` to `2019-01-01 02:59:59`
- `2018-12-31 17:59:59` to `2018-12-31 23:59:59`
- `2018-12-31 14:59:59` to `2018-12-31 20:59:59`
- `2018-12-31 11:59:59` to `2018-12-31 17:59:59`
- `2018-12-31 08:59:59` to `2018-12-31 14:59:59`
- `2018-12-31 05:59:59` to `2018-12-31 11:59:59`
- `2018-12-31 02:59:59` to `2018-12-31 08:59:59`
- `2018-12-30 23:59:59` to `2018-12-31 05:59:59`
- `2018-12-30 20:59:59` to `2018-12-31 02:59:59`

Backfills ignore the `no_paging` flag, always requesting all pages.

### `--bbox BBOX`

The bounding-box with which to restrict the results of this request.

The order is (separated by commas):

- southwest longitude,
- southwest latitude,
- northeast longitude,
- northeast latitude

For example:

```bash
--bbox -122.4183,37.7758,-122.4120,37.7858
```

### `--config CONFIG`

Path to a provider configuration file to use. The default is `.config`.

### `--device_id DEVICE_ID`

The device_id to obtain results for. Only applies to `--trips`.

### `--duration DURATION`

Number of seconds; with `--start_time` or `--end_time` defines a time query range.

### `--end_time END_TIME`

The end of the time query range for this request. Should be either int Unix seconds or ISO-8601 datetime format.

### `--no_load`

Do not attempt to load any returned data into a database.

### `--no_paging`

Flag indicating paging through the response should not occur. Return only the first page of data.

### `--no_validate`

Do not perform JSON Schema validation against the returned data.

### `--on_conflict_update`

Instead of ignoring, perform an UPDATE when incoming data conflicts with existing rows in the database.

### `--output OUTPUT`

Write data into JSON files in this path.

### `--providers PROVIDER [PROVIDER ...]`

One or more `provider_name` to query. The default is to query all configured providers.

### `--rate_limit RATE_LIMIT`

Number of seconds to pause between paging and backfill requests.

### `--ref REF`

Git branch name, commit hash, or tag at which to reference MDS. The default is `master`.

### `--registry REGISTRY`

Local file path to a `.csv` registry file to use, instead of downloading from GitHub.

### `--source SOURCE [SOURCE ...]`

One or more paths to (directories containing) MDS Provider JSON file(s). These will be read instead of requesting from Provider APIs.

The `--status_changes` and `--trips` flags will be respected if possible from the source file names.

Note that `--bbox`, `--end_time`, and other related querystring paramters don't apply for `--source`.

### `--stage_first STAGE_FIRST`

`False` to append records directly to the target tables. `True` to stage in a temp table before UPSERT.

Given an `int` greater than 0, determines the degrees of randomness when creating the temp table, e.g.

```bash
--stage_first 3
```

stages to a random temp table with `26*26*26` possible naming choices.

### `--start_time START_TIME`

The beginning of the time query range for this request. Should be either int Unix seconds or ISO-8601 datetime format.

### `--status_changes`

Flag indicating Status Changes should be requested.

### `--trips`

Flag indicating Trips should be requested.

### `--vehicle_id VEHICLE_ID`

The `vehicle_id` to obtain results for. Only applies to `--trips`.
